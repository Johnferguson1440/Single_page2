a user or login, and utilize the form to input your list. It saves
your login information and your unique list and allows you to access
whenever it is needed.

2.Type in a username and password.

3.Click the add user button.

4.Form will appear with "Your list" typed in. Change text to your items.

Now anytime you need to update your list you simply use the login button 
and your list will appear.

could be used together and which ones cannot. Deployed the application using Heroku
