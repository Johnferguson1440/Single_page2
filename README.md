#Shopping List MVP

#Synopsis:
This project was a brief 2 day sprint where I had to complete a MVP.
I decided to make a basic shopping list webpage that allows users to create
a user or login, and utilize the form to input their list. It saves
your login information and your unique list and allows you to access
whenever it is needed.

#To see it in action 

1.Go to https://intense-brushlands-33224.herokuapp.com/ 

2.Type in a username and password.

3.Click the add user button.

4.Input boxes will appear with "Your list" typed in. Change text to your items.

5.To add another row click the button add row.

6.If you check the box next to the item when you save the list it will delete the checked items and only keep the unchecked rows.

7.Click update list at the bottom of the list.

Now anytime you need to update your list you simply use the login button 
and your list will appear.

#This was a fun project to work on and allowed me to incorporate Full Stack operation.
Working with css was quite a challenge when trying to determine what properties 
could be used together and which ones cannot. Deployed the application using Heroku

#Heroku Deployment Tutorial-https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true
!!!!MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR DOTENV  INFORMATION ON THE HEROKU SITE UNDER SETTINGS IN CONFIG VARS!!!!
This makes it so your code can talk to your deployed database.
